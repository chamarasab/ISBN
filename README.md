## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


## Question
Design a class called ISBN to represent an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN for short. 
The ISBN consists of 10 digits divided into 4 parts. For example, the ISBN 0 941831 39 6 represents the 
following information: 
The first part: The first digit "0" signifies the book is from an English speaking country. 
The second part: "941831" identifies the publisher. 
The third part: "39" is the title number for the book. 
The fourth part: "6" is a check digit to indicate that the sum of the ISBN digits is 10. 
The class should have a constructor and methods to set and get the ISBN as a string. 
Design a Book class that represents relevant information about a book, including the book's title, author, 
publisher, city and date of publication, and price. The class should also include the field ISBN isbnNum; 
where ISBN is the class defined above. 
This class should include a constructor and the following methods: 
- setBookISBN: to set the ISBN for the book. 
- getAuthor: to return the author of the book. 
- getBookISBN: to get the ISBN of the book. 
- printDetails: to print the information of a book in the following form: 
 
## Output
> - Book Title: Object First with Java 
> - Book Author: David j. Barnes and Michael Kolling 
> - Publisher: Prentice Hall
> - ISBN: 0 941831 39 6
